This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Perl: the silent failure when accessing non-existent keys in a hash.  The `bug.pl` file shows how attempting to access a key that doesn't exist doesn't result in an error message, instead returning the undefined value `undef`. This can lead to hard-to-debug issues if not handled properly.  The `bugSolution.pl` file provides a corrected version that explicitly checks for the key's existence before accessing its value, preventing unexpected behavior.
